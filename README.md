# League_Of_Stats
A Website that will be able to compare stats between players/teams/champions/etc.

This website will track my development of this project, my assumptions about how/what
I am doing, and general philosophy. 

In every section there will be a:

--> General Design
--> Testing
--> Problems

All updates and code can be found in the folder Journal


So thanks for reading, and welcome to my project!
